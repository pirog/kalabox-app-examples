HipHop Drupal 7
===================

This is a nice app that runs Drupal 7 sites. It runs Facebook's nifty HipHop Virtual Machine to interpret PHP instead of php-fpm.

## Setup

Grab the example, install and start the app!

```
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/kalabox/kalabox-app-examples.git
cd hiphop-drupal7
npm install
kbox install -- --build-local
kbox start
```

Now visit `http://hiphop-drupal7.kbox` in your browser. It will likely tell you 'no input file'. To add code to your project you should now have a directory at called `code` inside of your app directory. Put your code in there to do all the things. If you are adding a large amount of code you might want to check on the status of syncthing over at `10.13.37.42:60008`

## Getting to your Database

This app will start with a database called `kalabox` and user `kalabox` with no password.

If you are importing a site and want to directly access the database you will need to find the outside port to use. You can do this by running `kbox containers`. If you are adding a large amount of code you might want to check on the status of syncthing over at `10.13.37.42:60008`

```json
{
  "id": "470fa7a966b672bcf0c85ab7281b3572d42e9b695e88186093dec57b1afb91c5",
  "name": "kb_hiphop-drupal7_db",
  "app": "hiphop-drupal7",
  "ports": [
    "3306/tcp=>49153"
  ],
  "running": true
}
{
  "id": "823e87472bd50b42a7fb7c51b5f42d41ec0b541a36b6085f8000367fafecd02f",
  "name": "kb_hiphop-drupal7_php",
  "app": "hiphop-drupal7",
  "ports": [
    "9000/tcp=>49154"
  ],
  "running": true
}
{
  "id": "05071466eba2b76789dbcd66639bc5cf38e299be3b54d82592ea6ea6e6850fbd",
  "name": "kb_hiphop-drupal7_web",
  "app": "hiphop-drupal7",
  "ports": [
    "443/tcp=>49155",
    "80/tcp=>49156"
  ],
  "running": true
}
{
  "id": "4288090d00d85267c2cd7d6d460a711ef1bcc4cf720e495e89c0db0c6b1a1753",
  "name": "kb_hiphop-drupal7_data",
  "app": "hiphop-drupal7",
  "running": false
}
```

With this you can access your database from the outside with

```
host: hiphop-drupal7.kbox
user: kalabox
password:
database: kalabox
port: 49153
```

You can import the DB via the CLI like this (when you have a local copy of said DB as well):
Make sure that you run kbox containers prior to this to get the port number as they change.

```
mysql -u kalabox -h example.kbox -P 49153 kalabox < ~/path/to/db.sql
```

If you are importing an especially large DB you may want to consider doing something like this
instead

```
gunzip < ~/path/to/db.sql | mysql -u kalabox -h example.kbox -P 49153 kalabox
```
